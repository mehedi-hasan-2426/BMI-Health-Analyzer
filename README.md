[GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) is installed for this repository.
Routine updates are grouped weekly, with a three-day release-age delay;
vulnerability PRs bypass both restrictions. All updates require manual review and
passing checks; major upgrades first require Dependency Dashboard approval.
